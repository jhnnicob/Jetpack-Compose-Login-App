## Setting up the Project
First of all download, the latest version of the android studio to perfectly run this application once you   
completed.
In this, we are using Android Studio Bumblebee | 2021.1.1 Patch 2, built on February 17, 2022.

Once you install the android studio, open it up and click New Project.

Since we are using the Jetpack Compose UI tool kit for creating the UI of our application, choose the Empty   
Compose Activity

Next is we are going to set up the name of our project, in my case it is (Jetpack Compose Login App). Then the package    
name of the application, basically it is a folder in a file directory. Then set up the location of your project in you   
computer in my case it is C:\Users\Nico\Documents\workspace\android\JetpackComposeLoginApp

The default language is Kotlin. We're leaving the Minimum SDK to its default which is API 21: Android 5.0 (Lollipop).  
Now we set up all we need, click finish to start coding.  

## Preview the Application    
Now we have all we need to start our first android application.
To preview your very first application without using an emulator or running in your device, just click Split at the top right corner of the android studio.
